        <p>"I would not be running for President if I didn't believe with all my heart that this is what the vast majority of Americans want for this country. For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else."</p>

                <p>But I also get the sense that there's a hunger that's deeper than that - a hunger that goes beyond any single cause or issue. What would be needed were Americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part - through protests and struggle, on the streets and in the courts, through a civil war and civil disobedience and always at great risk - to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time. He strengthened my faith, officiated my wedding, and baptized my children. We can do that. And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future. That is why I ordered the removal of our combat brigades by next August.</p>

                <p>John Kerry believes in energy independence, so we aren't held hostage to the profits of oil companies, or the sabotage of foreign oil fields. He strengthened my faith, officiated my wedding, and baptized my children. Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to. The fourth issue that I will address is democracy. Now let me be clear: issues of women's equality are by no means simply an issue for Islam. But all of us must recognize that education and innovation will be the currency of the 21st century, and in too many Muslim communities there remains underinvestment in these areas.</p>
                <p>That legacy of defeat was passed on to future generations - those young men and increasingly young women who we see standing on street corners or languishing in our prisons, without hope or prospects for the future. That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper. This history is well known.</p>

                <p>I was too young to be involved in that movement, but I felt I could play a small part in the continuing battle for justice by helping rebuild some of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods. What we have already achieved gives us hope - the audacity to hope - for what we can and must achieve tomorrow. Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to. It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road. </p>
                <p>We're not going to agree on everything, but we can disagree without being disagreeable. That is true genius of this nation. And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money. When a new flu infects one human being, all are at risk. It's a story with a simple truth: that violence is a dead end. The question is whether we spend that time focused on what pushes us apart, or whether we commit ourselves to an effort - a sustained effort - to find common ground, to focus on the future we seek for our children, and to respect the dignity of all human beings. </p>
                <p>He was a good-looking kid, six two, six three, clear eyed, with an easy smile. This cycle of suspicion and discord must end. Make no mistake: we do not want to keep our troops in Afghanistan. For centuries, black people in America suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation. Progress in the daily lives of the Palestinian people must be part of a road to peace, and Israel must take concrete steps to enable such progress. </p>
